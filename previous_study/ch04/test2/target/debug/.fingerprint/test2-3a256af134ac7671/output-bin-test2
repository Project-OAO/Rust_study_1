{"message":"cannot borrow `s1` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable","code":{"code":"E0502","explanation":"A variable already borrowed as immutable was borrowed as mutable.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0502\nfn bar(x: &mut i32) {}\nfn foo(a: &mut i32) {\n    let y = &a; // a is borrowed as immutable.\n    bar(a); // error: cannot borrow `*a` as mutable because `a` is also borrowed\n            //        as immutable\n    println!(\"{}\", y);\n}\n```\n\nTo fix this error, ensure that you don't have any other references to the\nvariable before trying to access it mutably:\n\n```\nfn bar(x: &mut i32) {}\nfn foo(a: &mut i32) {\n    bar(a);\n    let y = &a; // ok!\n    println!(\"{}\", y);\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on Rust's ownership system, take a look at
